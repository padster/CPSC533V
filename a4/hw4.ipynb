    "This assignment is meant to help you understand how to move from tabular approaches, topic of HW 3, to deep network approaches. You will implement the [Atari DQN / Deep Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) algorithm, which arguably kicked off the modern Deep Reinforcement Learning craze.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will be using PyTorch for our deep learning framework.  As a lead-in to DQN and to familiarize those who are unfamiliar with PyTorch, your first task is to use a behavior cloning (BC) approach to learn a policy.  Behavior cloning is a supervised learning method in which you have a dataset of expert demonstrations (state-action pairs) and your goal is to learn a policy $\\pi$ that mimics this expert.  (At any given state, your policy should choose the same action the export would.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since BC avoids the need to collect data from the policy you are trying to learn, it is relatively simple. \n",
    "This makes it a nice stepping stone for implementing DQN. Also, BC is quite relevant to modern approaches---for example its use as an initialization for systems like [AlphaGo][go] and [AlphaStar][star], which then use RL on top of it.  \n",

    "it's not always possible to have good expert demonstrations for a task in an environemnt and this is where reinforcement learning comes handy. Through the reward signal retrieved by interacting with the environment, the agent learns by itself what is a good policy and can learn to outperform the experts.\n",

    "We provide a pickle file with pre-collected expert demonstrations on CartPole from which to learn the policy $\\pi$. The data has been collected by using an expert policy on the environment adding a small amount of gaussian noise to it.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The first one is that we are not always lucky enough to have access to a dataset of expert demonstrations.\n",

The policy $\\pi$ only sees these \"perfect\" examples and has no knowledge on how to overcome from imperfect states. For this reason, as soon as it is presented with a slightly off-trajectory state, it will perform bad and will continuously deviate from a good trajectory without the possibility of recovering from errors.\n",

Your task is to update your Q-function as shown in the [Atari DQN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) environment. For now don't think about the experience replay buffer.

We provide an implementation in the file `replay_buffer.py`. Update the `train_reinforcement_learning` code to push a tuple to the replay buffer and to sample a batch for the `optimize_model` function. How does the replay buffer improve performances?"
